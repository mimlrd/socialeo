SOCIALEO - A test app for the mobile team at ENABLON

Getting Started
This is a test app as part of the interview process at ENABLON France. 

Create a mobile app with one view showing the list of the most recent photos posted on Instagram with the account below, following these guidelines:

• list must show the photos posted by the account provided below
• some photo metadata (title, comments, dates, number of likes…) should be displayed
• list must be built to show any number of photos

 I decide to add some features that could directly benefit ENABLON apps.

To get started you will need to have a valid Account access token to connect to Instagram APIs.
